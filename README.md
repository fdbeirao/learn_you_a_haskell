## Exercises and examples from Learn you a Haskell for great good

This is my second attempt at learning the [Haskell language](https://www.haskell.org/).

The difference is that this time, I have learnt the [ELM language](http://www.elm-lang.org/) and now Haskell just makes that much more sense.

For now, this repo contains examples and exercises from [Learn you a Haskell for great good - A beginner's guide](http://learnyouahaskell.com/).
